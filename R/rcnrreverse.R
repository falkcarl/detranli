#' Generate responses from model where human misses reverse-worded items
#' 
#' Generate a Likert-type sample to mimic the case where a participant may
#' complete most items diligently, but may accidentally miss reverse-worded
#' items.
#' 
#' @param data Existing "human" data matrix with which to mess up.
#' @param pointscales Vector of integers indicating how many Likert-type response categories there are for each item. 
#' @param whichreverse Vector of item indices for which items are most likely to be carelessly responded to.
#' @param severity Integer specifying how many items in \code{whichreverse} should be messed up for each respondent.
#' 
#' @details
#' Some participants respond diligently to many items, but sometimes misread
#' some items, especially reverse-worded items. Respondents do not see a
#' negation and assume the item is phrased in a positive way, leading them to
#' respond on the wrong end of the Likert-type response scale.
#' 
#' The current approach requires input from a hypothetical human sample, which
#' in examples is illustrated by fitting an (M)IRT model to data and using
#' the estimated model parameters to generate hypothetical humans.
#' 
#' Given a vector of item indices (\code{whichreverse}) for problematic items
#' (e.g., reverse-worded), and an integer for how many of these items are
#' problematic for any given respondent (\code{severity}), this function will
#' reverse code such items and then return the sample data matrix.
#' 
#' Note that such responses violate assumptions of \code{\link{cnrdetect}};
#' Item responses are not content unresponsive and are not exchangeable. As such,
#' rates of detecting such carelessness are not expected to have high sensitivity.
#' To the extent that contamination is low, it may be that such responders
#' are still flagged at higher rates than other diligent humans, however.
#' Further research on this topic is forthcoming.
#' 
#' Likert-type categories are from 1 (not 0) to K where K is the highest category.
#' 
#' @return The sample matrix.
